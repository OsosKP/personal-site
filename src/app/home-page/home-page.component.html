    <p>A proven leader, enthusiastic developer and avid learner in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
    <p>
      After graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in music, 
      I worked in the audio visual industry for five years. During this time I held
      numerous positions as part of a small team working to quickly accomodate client requests.

      I soon decided I wanted to accomplish more, and moved to Dublin, Ireland to pursue a 
      degree in computer science at University College Dublin. I will be graduating in the 
      summer of 2020 and moving to the east coast of the United States to work as a software engineer.

      In my studies at UCD, I've mainly focused on machine learning and web applications. The program
      is primarily focused around Java, with occasional work in Python and C. However, I have worked 
      to obtain significant extracurricular experience in other technologies. My main focus has been 
      on learning JavaScript with Node.js, Angular and React Native, though in my final year I will 
      be devoting my time to learning machine learning with Python and web development with Django.
